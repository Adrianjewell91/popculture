Conservatives on Reddit don’t know why the republicans voted No to the health care bill.
Black Forest Cakes come from the a random place in Germany where they wear wierd hats.
Rice, it is good, and better when drained. 
Seafood Videos 

Conservatives voted against the contraception bill because rich people like republican representatives naturally have a concern in the German cake business, so wouldn’t want to reduce their market size, which is exactly what would happen if women were guaranteed access to contraception. This is because pregnant women constitute a large percentage of the consumers of cake, especially black forest cake. 

Since last night, deep state market forces have been engaged in a subtle marketing technique of feeding advertisements according to principles of gustation: first course, which was seafood, then second course, which was a grain such as rice, and finally a third course which was dessert, black forest cake. This is in line with the order in which the videos were watched. 

Algorithms that analyze browsing habits, deduced that we had recently picked black forest cake for our wedding package, and a desire to get pregnant, so they offered up the video about black forest cake to stimulate the baby-making activities by playing up the historical value, since Hindus love old stories.  Then the republicans voted no, and voila, people will keep buying cake.
